A program for an EV3 robot to collect blocks and bring them to the correct stable to feed animals as part of a project in SPT1UE SS18 at [FH OÖ Campus Hagenberg](https://www.fh-ooe.at/en/hagenberg-campus).

## Goals
The robot should at least have the following features
* detect obstacles and avoid them
* detect the arena boundaries and do not cross them
* drive in every direction
* find fodder (little Duplo bricks)
* lift fodder to put it onto the correct stable
